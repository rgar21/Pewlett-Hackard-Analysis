# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Purpose 

The intent of this analysis is to compile tables that will display information for employees that are have, will, or are eligible for retirement in the upcoming years. We will create two tables that will allow management to gain a better understanding of how retired employees will affect each employment type. The first table will display the employees that are eligible for retirement and segment them by job title. The second title will display all employees that are eligible for a mentorship program. Using these tables we will be able to help management decide what job title needs the mentorship program the most.

## Results

  * Based on the chart below, we can state that the company is potentially losing a bulk of its engineers between       both senior and entry level
  * Secondly, a majoriy of our current employees that are eligible for retirement hold senior positions that          require a great amount of experience to obtain.

  * Thirdly, we can see that we have over 1500 current employees that are currently eligible for our mentorship       program.
  * Lastly, these 1500 current employees will not be sufficient enough to cover the deficit of employees that will     leave the company in the upcoming years.

## Summary

At this moment the "silver tsunami" is threatening to wipe over 60% of our workforce over the coming years. We are simply not prepared for this type of turnover in so many senior positions. 


Cross reference individual departments in the retirement title and eligibility to cross reference even more
